Live demo: [sass-guidelines-and-conventions-pink.vercel.app](https://sass-guidelines-and-conventions-pink.vercel.app/)

Teck stack: react, typescript, sass, jest, react-testing-library

Following sass guidelines and conventions and BEM naming convention to write more managable projects, with mobile first development. i tried to extract repeating elements of the project into components as much as possible.

As for testing i used jest and react testing library to unit and integration test components.
